# Project Primal Genesis - Task List

## Project Status Overview

**Current Progress: ~25% toward complete game**

The game has solid core mechanics and systems implemented and working, but this represents only the foundational layer. While players can experience a basic gameplay loop, the game needs MASSIVE work in graphics, animations, sound, polish, and fun-factor improvements before being a complete, enjoyable game. **Critical systems work, but we're missing everything that makes a game visually appealing and fun to play.**

### üéÆ **WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING (Core Systems):**
- ‚úÖ Combat mechanics and enemy AI
- ‚úÖ Item collection and stat progression
- ‚úÖ Multiplayer networking
- ‚úÖ Basic game loop (spawn ‚Üí fight ‚Üí progress)
- ‚úÖ Status effects and advanced item mechanics

### üö® **WHAT'S MISSING (95% of game development):**
- ‚ùå **All Graphics & Animations**: Currently just colored rectangles
- ‚ùå **Sound Design & Music**: No audio whatsoever
- ‚ùå **Visual Effects**: No particles, explosions, or feedback
- ‚ùå **UI/UX Polish**: Basic UI, no menus or polish
- ‚ùå **Game Feel**: No juice, feedback, or satisfaction
- ‚ùå **Content Variety**: Needs more enemies, items, environments
- ‚ùå **Fun Factor**: Current state is functional but not engaging

### ‚úÖ MAJOR RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS

#### **üéÅ CRITICAL BUG FIXES (COMPLETED)**
- **Item Pickup System Fixed**: All interactable types now work correctly (chests, barrels, tri-shops)
- **Enemy Death System Fixed**: Proper cleanup, XP spawning, no more negative health issues
- **Status Effects Integration**: Poison, fire, chill, vulnerability systems fully functional
- **Elite Enemy System**: 6 elite variants with enhanced stats and unique behaviors

#### **‚ö° Advanced Item System (34 TOTAL ITEMS)**
- **17 New Powerful Items**: Poison glands, fire orbs, chain lightning staff, life steal charms
- **Advanced Effect Triggers**: On-hit, on-kill, fifth-hit, low-health effects
- **Status Effect Items**: Items that apply poison, burning, chill, vulnerability
- **AoE Damage**: Explosive rounds, Nova device, area damage mechanics
- **Equipment Items**: Quantum Phase Shifter dash, Alien Spore Pod grenade

#### **üß™ Complete Status Effects System**
- **Poison**: Damage over time with stacking (max 10 stacks, 20% more damage per stack)
- **Burn**: Fire damage over time with duration management
- **Chill**: Movement speed slow effects (30% slowdown)
- **Vulnerability**: Damage taken multipliers (1.5x default, configurable)

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES (CURRENTLY UNRESOLVED)

### **üì¶ Item Pickup Performance - SEVERE LAG PERSISTS**
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ATTEMPTED FIX FAILED** - Non-blocking system did not resolve the issue

**Problem**: When players pick up items, the game freezes and the player teleports across the screen due to lag. This gets progressively worse with more items collected.

**What Was Attempted**:
- Implemented Promise-based microtask processing to defer heavy calculations
- Moved `applyItemEffectsToPlayer()` to async background processing
- Added equipment abilities (dash/grenade) to async processing

**Why It Failed**:
- Microtask processing still blocks the main thread during calculation
- Item effect recalculation is computationally expensive (loops through all items and effects)
- The async approach doesn't actually prevent blocking - just delays it slightly
- Real-time game loop cannot tolerate any blocking operations

**Technical Root Cause**:
```typescript
// This calculation is too expensive for real-time gameplay:
for (let itemIndex = 0; itemIndex < itemsCount; itemIndex++) {
  for (let effectIndex = 0; effectIndex < effectsCount; effectIndex++) {
    // Complex stat calculations that block the game loop
  }
}
```

**Real Solutions Needed**:
- Pre-calculate item combinations and cache results
- Incremental stat updates instead of full recalculation
- Web Workers for true background processing
- Simplified item effect calculations

### **üåü Beacon Interaction - COMPLETELY BROKEN**
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE** - Beacon visible but cannot be interacted with

**Problem**: Beacon now spawns and shows distance correctly, but players cannot interact with it to progress the game. The interaction system fails specifically for the beacon.

**What Works**:
- ‚úÖ Beacon spawns immediately on game start
- ‚úÖ Distance display works ("üåü BEACON: 1250m")
- ‚úÖ Beacon is visible on the map
- ‚úÖ Other interactables (chests, barrels) work correctly

**What's Broken**:
- ‚ùå Player cannot interact with beacon (press E near beacon does nothing)
- ‚ùå Cannot activate beacon to start holdout phase
- ‚ùå Game progression completely blocked

**Potential Causes**:
- Beacon not properly registered in spatial grid for collision detection
- Interaction range/detection logic not working for beacon type
- Beacon missing from interactable update loop
- Client-side interaction detection not synced with server state

**Debugging Needed**:
- Check if beacon appears in `this.state.interactables` on server
- Verify spatial grid includes beacon for collision detection
- Test interaction range calculations for beacon vs other interactables
- Compare working interactable (chest) vs broken (beacon) implementation

## üìä REALISTIC PROGRESS ASSESSMENT

**Current State**: Game is **functionally broken** despite having many working systems.

**What Actually Works**:
- ‚úÖ Basic combat and movement
- ‚úÖ Enemy spawning and AI
- ‚úÖ Some interactables (chests, barrels)
- ‚úÖ Beacon visibility and distance tracking

**What Blocks Gameplay**:
- ‚ùå **Item pickup lag** makes collection unbearable
- ‚ùå **Beacon interaction broken** prevents game progression
- ‚ùå **Performance issues** make the game unplayable

**Progress Reality**: We have built many complex systems, but the **core gameplay experience is fundamentally broken**. The game needs critical performance and interaction fixes before any additional features.
