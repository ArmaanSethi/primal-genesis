## 🐛 CURRENT ISSUES (Minor Polish Needed)

### Active Issues (Low Priority)
- **Spitter Projectile Visibility:** Green projectiles sometimes hard to see during gameplay
- **Equipment Freeze:** Rare equipment activation can cause brief freeze (needs optimization)
- **Chest Pickup Lag:** Minor performance drop when picking up large stacks of items
- **Health Display Capping:** Health can show over max (e.g., 120/100) - visual only

### Recently Fixed
- ✅ **Beacon Visibility:** Beacon now clearly visible as large green star
- ✅ **Altar Confusion:** Altar spawns far from beacon to avoid visual interference
- ✅ **Item Pickup:** Automatic pickup working correctly
- ✅ **UI Overlap:** Text overlapping in sidebar resolved
- ✅ **Boss Spawning:** Boss now spawns safely away from edges
- ✅ **🌟 BEACON SPAWNING IMMEDIATELY:** Beacon now spawns at level start instead of after 3 enemies
- ✅ **🧭 BEACON DIRECTION INDICATOR:** Added distance display and arrow pointing to beacon
- ✅ **📱 BEACON ACCESSIBILITY:** Players can always find beacon with visual guidance system
